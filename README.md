### Title: Analysing the correlation between two SDGs

*S.E. Rasing, Sustainability Analysis in Pyhon, Msc Industrial Ecology, Leiden*

This repository contains my submssion for Assignment A for the course Sustainability Analysis in Python. 
The code in this assignment can be used to analyse the relationship between a social and an environmental Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the United Nations (UN). 
For the scope of this project I have selected the following two SDGs:
- SDG 2.4.1: Sustainable Agriculture
- SDG 15.5.1: Red list index
The repository includes all files used and created when running the code file Assignment_A_main, which is placed in the Code folder.

**Data**
The data for this project is taken from several sources, which are all saved in the Data folder. 
Data 1: AG_LND_SUST_PRXCSS.xlsx
- SDG data is sourced from the UN Stats Data Portal. This file includes country-level data series for SDG 2.4.1 across all available years (1).
Data 2: ER_RSK_LST.xlsx
- SDG data is sourced from the UN Stats Data Portal. This file includes country-level data series for SDG 2.4.1 across all available years (1).
Data 3: WPP2024_F01_LOCATIONS.xlsx
- Country codes are obtained from the UN World Population Prospects Documentation (2)
Data 4: WPP2024_TotalPopulationBySex.csv.gz
- Total Population data for al countries is obtained from the UN World Population Prospect projects (3).
