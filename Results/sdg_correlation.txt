 - SDG 2.4.1, Sustainable Agriculture Index 
 - SDG 15.5.1, Red List Index 

The results obtained from the Spearnmanr test are the following: 
 - Correlation coefficient: 0.2961735916165568 
 - P-value: 0.07829126107490848 

 The correlation coefficient (0.2961735916165568), indicates a trade-off between the two SDG indicators.

Since the identified p-value (0.07829126107490848) is above the significance level (0.05), we can conclude that the observed the correlation is statistically insignificant.
